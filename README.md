# Recipe Share
This website lets users share recipes that they like. Other users can browse these recipes and upvote ones they enjoyed.

For the back-end, I used the Django Framework, which uses Python. I implemented user authorization and stored the recipes using a PostgreSQL database. For the front-end, I used the Bootstrap framework, which uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The Accounts and Recipes folers are each Django Apps.  The Accounts folder holds files related to user authorization and user sign up, login, and logout screens.  The Recipes folder holds files related to the recipes that are shared and the home and recipe list screens.

Settings file has secret information hidden.
