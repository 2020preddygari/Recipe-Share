# Recipe-Share
This website lets users share recipes that they like. Other users can browse these recipes and upvote ones they enjoyed.

For the back-end, I used the Django Framework, which uses Python. I implemented user authorization and stored the recipes using a PostgreSQL database. For the front-end, I used the Bootstrap framework, which uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
